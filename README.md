# Statistical-analysis-of-Indian-stocks
We have selected 10 stocks that are listed on Nifty 50 index of Indian Stock Market on the basis of the
trading volume and the size of the organization. We have selected a good mix of public issued private
and government run organizations.
From this project, we plan to formulate investment strategies by deriving meaningful insights from
statistical tests on the selected stocks.
Analysis of the stocks include calculating daily log-returns of each individual stock and later comparing
log-returns of pairs of stocks to determine correlation between them.
